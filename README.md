# Algorithms

## Description
This repository provides the implementation of various algorithms that I learned during my **Design & Analysis of Algorithms** class (CS 2413). These algorithms are coded in C language and cover a range of topics, including Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and more.  

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as to develop my programming skills in C. Additionally, this repository can be used as a reference by anyone who is interested in learning about algorithms or for those who want to refresh their knowledge.
